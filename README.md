# statusbar

Some modules to populate the statusbar created by [`lemonbar` (xft fork)](https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/lemonbar-xft).
Actually there is one binary which periodically updates the modules (at
individual frequencies) and one binary to update a single module on demand.
Part of my bspwm setup.

Note: parts are taken from [`vanela-panel`](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/void-bspwm-dotfiles/blob/2e783c05073e2dcb2c952c9eeada0519c410528a/home/addy/.scripts/vanela#L4)
